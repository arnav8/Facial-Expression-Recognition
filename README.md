# Facial-Expression-Recognition
Used Kaggle FER2013 dataset and built the Facial emotion recognition using Keras and added a real time Webcam implementation Download here https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge

# Dependency
(used a virtual environment)

`pip install Keras`

`pip install Tensorflow`

`pip install Opencv`

# Usage
For real time facial emotion recognition, execute command:
`python3 realtime_facial_expression.py`

For detecting the facial expression in a test image you can execute the command:
`python3 image_test.py test.jpg`
